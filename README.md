BoxerJS
=======


Yet another jQuery lightbox preview plugin. Why make another one? Making a plugin teaches you Javascript modular pattern and DOM manipulation. Like many  smart programmers would tell you. You learn more with doing than just reading lessons on the matter. If you find my plugin helpful send me a tweet or a like.  Happy coding!

Like many projects you start with the problem. With the problem in mind, you can  set out with a roadmap that will keep you focused on task.

How do I use jQuery to transform my image links into overlay previews?


## Limitations


Let's add restrictions. Limitations produce more creative ideas than freedom. So for these problem I want the solution to be:

* a jQuery plugin
* proof-of-concept include images and thumbnails - formatted as "image.jpg" and "image_thumb.jpg" correspondingly
* does not know anything about the images - size or compression.
* anchors are optional, but for semantic purposes and accessibility, thumbnails are wrapped in anchor tags with a corresponding href to the target URL.
    e.g.

```html

    <a href="my_cool_image.png">
        <img src="my_cool_image_thumb.png" />
    </a>

```

* must iterate on a block and not the whole page. 



## Solution


Plugin will iterate on children of blocks converted to boxerJS blocks.  

```html

<div class="boxer">
    <h3>Thumbnails</h3>
    <a href="assets/dog1.jpg" title="Dog 1"><img src="assets/dog1_thumb.jpg" alt="dog 1"></a>
    <a href="assets/dog2.jpg" title="Dog 2"><img src="assets/dog2_thumb.jpg" alt="dog 2" data-pin-nopin="true"></a>
    <a href="assets/dog3.jpg" title="Dog 3"><img src="assets/dog3_thumb.jpg" alt="dog 3" data-pin-nopin="true"></a>
</div>

```


```javascript

    $(".boxer").boxer();

```


TO prevent performance issues, the event listener/callback must be attached to the parent, instead of the child elements. Through event delegation optimize the event loop.
